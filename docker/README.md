micca (MICrobial Community Analysis) is a software pipeline for the processing
of amplicon sequencing data, from raw sequences to OTU tables, taxonomy
classification and phylogenetic tree inference. The pipeline can be applied to
a range of highly conserved genes/spacers, such as 16S rRNA gene, Internal
Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA.

The RDP classifier is included in this Docker distribution.
